== TLS Versions

These cipher suites make use of the authenticated encryption with
additional data defined in TLS 1.2 [RFC5288].

* They *MUST NOT* be negotiated in older versions of TLS.

* Clients *MUST NOT* offer these cipher suites if they do not offer
TLS 1.2 or later.

* Servers that select an earlier version of TLS *MUST NOT* select one
of these ciphersuites.  Earlier versions do not have support for AEAD; for instance,
the TLSCiphertext structure does not have the "aead" option in TLS
1.1.  Because TLS has no way for the client to indicate that it
supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier versions, a non-compliant server
might potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one of the
cipher suites in this document.

* Clients *MUST* check the TLS version and generate a fatal
"illegal_parameter" alert if they detect an incorrect version.
